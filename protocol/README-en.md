Today you will do the final Assessment 3. You will repeat the assessments you did about a month ago to measure how you've changed after the Month of Wellbeing.

Today's assessment should take **less than 20 minutes to complete**. You'll need to do it in one sitting. If you close your browser, you'll have to restart the ongoing survey by re-clicking on the link in the email (do not refresh).

If you are using a **laptop or desktop** (recommended) and run into any **issues**, you can download your data with the Download button in the menu and send it to us. Instructions are at the end of the session under the Submit Responses button in the menu.
